# Rank, Score & Optimize Java Objects

Improve AI is a machine learning platform for quickly implementing app optimization, personalization, and recommendations for [iOS](https://github.com/improve-ai/swift-ranker), [Android](https://github.com/improve-ai/java-ranker), and [Python](https://github.com/improve-ai/python-ranker).

The SDKs provide simple APIs for AI [decisions](https://improve.ai/decisions/), [ranking](https://improve.ai/ranking/), [scoring](https://improve.ai/scoring/), and [multivariate optimization](https://improve.ai/multivariate-optimization/) that execute immediately, on-device, with zero network latency.
Items and their rewards are with the [Improve AI Tracker / Trainer](https://github.com/improve-ai/tracker-trainer) and updated models are trained regularly for continuous learning.

## Installation

Add JitPack in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories

}
```

## Usage

Create a list of JSON encodable items and simply call *new Ranker.rank(items)*.

For instance, in an bedtime story app, you may have a list of *Themes*:

```java
themes = Arrays.asList(
        Map.of("font", "Helvetica", "size", 12, "color", "#000000"),
        Map.of("font", "Comic Sans", "size", 16, "color", "#F0F0F0"));

rankedThemes = ranker.rank(themes);
```

To obtain a ranked list of themes, use just one line of code:

```java
List rankedThemes = ranker.rank(themes);
```

## Reward Assignment

Easily train your rankers using [reinforcement learning](https://improve.ai/reinforcement-learning/).

First, track when an item is used:

```java
RewardTracker tracker = new RewardTracker("themes", trackUrl, null);
String rewardId = tracker.track(theme, themes);
```

Later, if a positive outcome occurs, provide a reward:

```java
if (purchased) {
    tracker.addReward(profit, rewardId);
}
```

Reinforcement learning uses positive rewards for favorable outcomes (a "carrot") and negative rewards for undesirable outcomes (a "stick"). 
By assigning rewards based on business metrics, such as revenue or conversions, the system optimizes these metrics over time.

## Contextual Ranking & Scoring

Improve AI turns XGBoost into a contextual multi-armed bandit, meaning that context is considered when making ranking or scoring decisions.

Often, the choice of the best variant depends on the context that the decision is made within. 
Let's take the example of greetings for different times of the day:

```java
List<String> greetings = Arrays.asList(
        "Good Morning",
        "Good Afternoon",
        "Good Evening",
        "Buenos DÃ­as",
        "Buenas Tardes",
        "Buenas Noches");
```

rank() also considers the context of each decision. The context can be any JSON-encodable data structure.

```java
HashMap context = Map.of("day_time", 12.0, "language", "en");
List<String> ranked = ranker.rank(greetings, context);
String greeting = ranked.get(0);
```

Trained with appropriate rewards, Improve AI would learn from scratch which greeting is best for each time of day and language.
